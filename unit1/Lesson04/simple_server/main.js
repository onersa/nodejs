// The first line of code assigns the port number you’ll use for this application:
// 3000
const port = 3000

// Then you use require to import a specific Node.js module called http and save it as a
// constant
const http = require("http");

// You also require the http-status-codes package to provide constants representing HTTP status codes
const httpStatus = require("http-status-codes");

// Next, you use the http variable as a reference to the HTTP module to create a server,
// using that module’s createServer function, and store the resulting server in a variable
// called app
const app = http.createServer((request, response) => {

    // You log that a request was received from the client
    console.log("Received an incoming request!");

//     The first line uses a writeHead method to define some basic properties of the
// response’s HTTP header
// HTTP headers contain fields of information that describe the
// content being transferred in a request or response
// In this case, you’re returning httpStatus.OK, which represents a 200 response code, and
// an HTML content-type to indicate that the server received a request successfully and
// will return content in the form of HTML
    response.writeHead(httpStatus.StatusCodes.OK, {
      "Content-Type": "text/html",
    });

    // Following this block, you assign a local variable, responseMessage, with your response message in HTML
    let responseMessage = "<h1>Hello, Mr Universe!</h1>";

    // Right below that line, you’re writing a line of HTML in the response with write and closing the response with end
    response.write(responseMessage);
    response.write(responseMessage);
    response.write(responseMessage);    
    response.end();

    //You also log your response at
    // this point so you can see that a response was sent from the server itsel
    console.log(`Sent a response : ${responseMessage}`);
  });

// The last line of code takes the server instance, app, and runs the listen method to indicate 
// that the server is ready for incoming requests at port 3000
app.listen(port);
console.log(`The server has started and is listening on port number:${port}`);
